Geospatial analysis is predicated on the ability to evaluate geospatial coincidence between geo-
referenced objects. The sheer volume of remotely sensed data and their irregular spacing are a
disabling roadblock for scientists, currently only circumventable by spatiotemporal discretiza-
tion and sampling of observations. While spatial discretization simplifies the evaluation of
geospatial coincidence, it decreases the data fidelity. The alternative geospatial referencing and
indexing schema, the Spatio-Temporal Adaptive-Resolution Encoding (STARE), built on top
of a Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM), allows performant spatial coincidence evaluation of
undiscretized observation. We present the software collection built around STARE that en-
ables scientists to process remote sensing data at the actual sensor geolocation accuracy and
resolution. It contains methods to read conventional geospatial data and to convert legacy
representation into STARE representation. It further contains STARE based geoprocessing
methods and storage backends for STARE indexed data.
