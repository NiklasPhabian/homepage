# Welcome to my page!
I am a mechanical engineer, environmental scientist, scientific programmer, and educator. 

Over the years, I seem to have created a loose collection of notes and recipes on various projects.  This website is an attempt to force myself to structure those notes and maybe; just maybe make them helpful for someone other than just me. 

My interests and thus my notes are somewhat loosely connected to 
- [**geospatial data engineering**](about/#geospatial-data-engineering)
- [**scavenging**](about/#scavenging) (giving stuff a second life)
- [**energy and energy markets**](about/#energy-and-efficiency) 
- bunch of [**random stuff**](about/#random)
